<h2 style="text-align: center;">SUMMARY OF MY FIRST DAYS</h2>
 <p style=" font-size: mediun4px; color:rgb(2, 62, 42); text-align: center;"> The first day was both frieghtening and exicting especially bescause I was anxious about how the people would
conduct them selves.<br> I was suprisingly meet with the warmest welcome I have ever recieved in my histoty of 
  learning. <br>This made me feel at home and this feeling was amplified by the variety of foods that Achirachix
  had to offer.<br>I was able to make friends with different people
    who I learned to trust and made my family.<br>Despite all the available love i was getting, i still felt homesick.
